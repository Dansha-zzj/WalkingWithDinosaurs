## Project Description

Client: Sebastian Steinig, University of Bristol

Project: The initial version of the project's web application developed by Sebastian Steinig team, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Geographical Sciences (University of Bristol). The application using an innovative and interesting way to understand past and future climate changes around the world. It uses an intuitive new web application to show a 3D view of past worlds and environments, such as trees, even dinosaurs, based purely on the latest scientific data and climate model simulations. Our team will decide and create a fun solution for users to explore and learn about this fascinating Earth. Solutions can range from simpler third-person games all the way to immersive augmented or virtual reality solutions.


## User stories

As a geologist, our client wants to add some function (game or VR/VR) so that he can better present his research And make people better understand Earth's past and future climate change


## Stakeholders

School of Geographical Sciences(Lectures & Administrators)-These people use the application to show the climate change in the past world. And they can present their latest research data to students in a more intuitive way. Moreover, they want it to be easy to use, which present visually and intuitively.

School of Geographical Sciences(Students)-These people watch the application to learn the knowledge about climate change and geography. This can help them more intuitively understand the past and future of different areas of the world through 3D view in class. Additionally, they want the application to be more graphic and immersive.

University of Bristol-The university should ensure the confidentiality and security of this application. And,they should secure the database so that it is not subject to any scrutiny or reputational damage. If the project is a great success and involves a range of issues such as museum displays, the vital interests of the creator should be protected.
